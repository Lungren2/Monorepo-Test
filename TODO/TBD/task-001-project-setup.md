# Task: Project Setup and Configuration

## Objective

Set up the complete project management system with TODO directory structure, task templates, and Git workflow integration for the Robot APVSYS project.

## Dependencies

1. Create comprehensive project overview document
2. Set up TODO directory structure with four subdirectories (TBD, Doing, Done, Reviewed)
3. Create task templates with required headers
4. Update main rule file to bind project overview and TODO system
5. Document Git workflow requirements
6. Create sample task to demonstrate the system

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project overview document exists and contains comprehensive project description
- [ ] TODO directory structure is properly created with all four subdirectories
- [ ] Task template exists with all required headers (Objective, Dependencies, Acceptance Criteria, DAG)
- [ ] Main rule file binds project-overview.md and TODO directory
- [ ] Git workflow is documented with mandatory commit requirements
- [ ] Sample task demonstrates the complete workflow
- [ ] All files are committed to version control

## Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)

No dependencies - this is the foundational task for the project management system.

## Implementation Notes

- This task establishes the foundation for all future development work
- The system integrates with Cursor IDE rules and context management
- All future tasks will follow the established workflow and structure
- The project overview serves as the single source of truth for project functionality

## Testing

- Verify all directories are created correctly
- Confirm task template has all required sections
- Test Git workflow by moving sample task through directories
- Validate rule file integration with Cursor IDE

## Status

- [x] Created
- [x] In Progress
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Reviewed
