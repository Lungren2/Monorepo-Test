## Style Rules

* **File Headers**
  Use banner comments at the top of all front-end and database files:

* **Code Structure**

  * Abstract logic into functions/methods for clarity.
  * Keep files under **300 lines** where possible.
  * Use *sane* and *consistent* naming conventions for any file names

* **Front-End Project Organization**

  * Silo code into **feature folders**.
  * Each folder must include a `README.md`.
  * Do **not** use barrel exports; import directly from other files.

* **Querying Rules**
  * Major database interactions must go through stored procedures
  * Any use of raw SQL should be parameterized (Complex business logic belongs in stored procedures)
